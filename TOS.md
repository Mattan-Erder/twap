# **TWAP PROTOCOL AND SMART CONTRACT TERMS OF USE**

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) are a multi-party contract among you and all other participants in the current and future decentralized, blockchain-based protocol for executing Time Weighted Average Price trading strategies, initially developed by Orbs Ltd. (“Orbs”) and made available in open source code form at the GitHub repositories located at <https://github.com/orbs-network/twap> (the “Protocol”), which allows users to engage in certain complex trading strategies on decentralized exchanges (collectively, the “Services”). These Terms apply to all participants in the Protocol, including: (i) the individuals and entities that are the end-users of such applications or that otherwise interact directly or indirectly with the Protocol (“Users”); (ii) any exchange or trading platform on which the Protocol has been integrated or utilized to provide the Services on such exchange or trading platform (each, an “Exchange”); (iii) those participants interacting with the Protocol by providing bids in order to fill orders and execute transactions on the Protocol (each, a “Taker”), which takers may include the validator nodes (“Guardians”) who operate that certain decentralized blockchain infrastructure developed by Orbs (the “Orbs Network”), which now or in the future may provide certain functionality to the Protocol; and (v) any and all entities and persons affiliated with Orbs, and their respective current or future subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, and any other person or entity with any involvement in developing the Protocol, in each case, or any other such person or entity, including, without limitation, Orbs (collectively, the “Subject Persons”). All users of and participants in the Protocol, including Guardians, Exchanges, Takers and Users will collectively be referred to as “you” or “your.” Your use of and access to the Protocol and any Services or applications available through the Protocol, any financial transactions and any information, text, photos, graphics, videos, idea, concept, discovery, invention, development, technology, algorithm, program, code, documentation or other material or information available on or through the Protocol is subject to these Terms.

These Terms are a legal agreement, and they contain important information on your legal rights, remedies and obligations. You may use the Protocol only if you can form a binding contract.

Please read and review these Terms carefully. 

The Protocol is available only to individuals who (a) are at least eighteen (18) years old; and (b) possess the legal capacity to enter into these Terms (on behalf of themselves and their organization) and to form a binding agreement under any applicable law. You hereby represent that you possess the legal authority to enter into these Terms on your and your organization's behalf and to form a binding agreement under any applicable law, to use the Protocol in accordance with these Terms, and to fully perform your obligations hereunder.

### 1. **Overview of the Protocol**

The Protocol is a smart contract-based protocol that allows Users to receive the Services by creating orders that wait in the smart contract until they are filled by Takers and executed on one or more Exchanges. 

You hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that the Protocol is decentralized network and the Subject Persons: (A) are not responsible for the development or launch of the Protocol and (B) do not undertake any responsibility to operate, maintain, support or otherwise authorize any activity related to the Protocol. 

***TO THE EXTENT LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE, THE PROTOCOL IS PROVIDED ON AN*** “***AS IS***” ***BASIS. ORBS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSS INCURRED TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON AS A RESULT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF PROTOCOL.*** 

***YOUR USE OF THE PROTOCOL IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.***

*Fees*. There is currently fee for utilizing the Protocol or transactions conducted therein. However, such fees may be charged in the future, and in such cases any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you incurring the fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Takers may set fees in their bids, which will be payable by Users in the event that such bids are taken. Network fees (including, without limitation “miner’s fees”) required to use the Platform or an underlying blockchain may apply to a transaction. Your third party wallet application may attempt to calculate such a fee for you, which calculation may not be sufficient, or it may be excessive. You may select a greater or lesser fee. You are solely responsible for selecting and paying any such fee. In addition, Orbs and/or one of the Exchanges may from time to time deploy “honest” bidders, which limit their fees to only the network fees incurred in filling your TWAP orders. 

*Be safe & secure*: If you elect to utilize the Protocol, we highly recommend that you educate yourself on blockchain industry standard recommendations on how to be proactive about your security. 

*The Subject Persons are not responsible for any loss*: The Protocol, the Exchanges, the assets traded thereon, any underlying blockchain network, and any third party wallet software such as Metamask that may be used by you, are all still under active development and (a) may contain bugs, errors and defects, (b) may function improperly or be subject to periods of downtime and unavailability, (c) may result in total or partial loss or corruption of data and (d) may be modified at any time, including through the release of subsequent versions, all with or without notice to you. While we have thoroughly tested the Protocol, there is always the possibility something unexpected happens that causes your assets to be lost. Please do not transact more than you are willing to lose, and please be careful.

*Non-Custodial Protocol*. You do not create an account or give us your funds to hold onto. No data leaves your computer / your browser. At no point will the Protocol ever take custody of your digital assets, which will move directly from your wallet to the Exchange on which the trades are executed, and vice versa. The Protocol makes it easy for you to create and execute multiple orders and sophisticated strategies on one or more Exchanges. You acknowledge that the Protocol and the Subject Persons are not responsible for transferring, safeguarding, or maintaining your private keys or any digital assets associated therewith. If you lose, mishandle or have stolen associated digital currency private keys, you acknowledge that you may not be able to recover associated digital currency, and that the Subject Persons are not responsible for such loss. You acknowledge that the Subject Persons is not responsible for any loss, damage or liability arising from your failure to comply with the terms hereunder.

*Public Nature of Transactions*. Transactions that take place utilizing the Protocol are managed and confirmed via an underlying blockchain. You understand that your public address and the details of any order you create and any transactions executed on your behalf will be made publicly visible whenever you utilize the Protocol.

You acknowledge that entering into any transaction electronically (including without limitation all records relating to such transactions) constitutes your agreement and intent to be bound by and to pay for such agreements and transactions. Such transactions may, among other things, include payments between participants for their activities on the network, fees paid to Bidders for executing your orders, fees paid to exchanges on which your transactions are executed and amounts paid by you in exchange for other digital assets as part of such transactions. Notwithstanding that such transactions and other similar transactions may be allowed, facilitated or encouraged by the design of the Protocol, you acknowledge and agree that the actual entry into any such agreement, transaction or arrangement utilizing the Protocol is accomplished as a peer-to-peer transaction between the parties thereto and is subject to the terms of the agreement between such parties. You are solely responsible for any disputes you may have with any counterparty or any other party regarding such agreements and transactions. THE SUBJECT PERSONS DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN, BY AND AMONG YOU AND ANY USERS, BIDDERS, EXCHANGE OR TRANSACTION COUNTERPARTY. 

*Dependence on Third Party Applications*. The Protocol is a smart contract launched on one or more underlying blockchain networks that takes orders for transactions that are executed with the assistance of Bidders by a connection between your wallet and liquidity pools available on an Exchange. All underlying blockchain networks, wallet software, Bidders and Exchanges are third parties or third party applications, as the case may be. The Subject Persons do not own or control these or any other third-party site, product or service that you may choose to access, visit or use in the course or for the purpose of interacting with the Protocol. Accordingly, by using the Protocol, you acknowledge and agree that the Subject Persons have no control over, and no duty to take any action regarding any activities of such third parties. The Subject Persons will not be held liable, and are not liable, for the acts or omissions of such third parties, nor are the Subject Persons Liable, nor will they be held liable, for any damage you may suffer as a result of interacting with or using such third parties. 

*Risk Disclosures Regarding the Protocol*. By utilizing the Service or interacting with the Protocol in any way, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic and blockchain systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, blockchain-based software systems and decentralized finance platforms such as the Exchanges, including, but not limited to, the following risks: 

1. In order to be completed, any transaction created with the Protocol must be confirmed and recorded on the applicable underlying blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks operated by independent third parties, which are not owned, controlled or operated by the Subject Persons. 
2. The Subject Persons do not control the actions of nodes on the underlying blockchains, any Bidders, or the Exchanges, and therefore cannot and do not ensure that any 
   transactions you engage in via the Protocol will be confirmed or confirmed correctly on the relevant networks. The transaction details you submit via the Protocol may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the applicable networks used to process the transaction. We do not guarantee that the Protocol can transfer title or right in any digital assets or make any warranties whatsoever with regard to title. 
3. Once transaction details have been submitted via the Protocol, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or transaction details.
4. The Protocol has been designed such that the presence of one “honest” Taker (i.e, a Taker who charges only reimbursement for gas fees) should result in an output amount that 
   is as close as possible to spot market prices. While Orbs or other parties may implement automated “honest” Takers, it cannot be guaranteed that an “honest” taker will be available and all such Takers are in beta and may not operate as intended. If an honest Taker is not available or fails to function as intended, your transaction may incur fees payable to the Taker offering the lowest fee rate in their bid to the Protocol with respect to your transaction. Such fees may fluctuate depending on Taker behavior. 
5. If you are using a user interface to interact with a protocol, such user interface may display estimated information such as current market price, output tokens to be 
   received in a TWAP order or other information with respect to your entered transactions. All such information displayed on a user interface may be inaccurate and such user interfaces may contain errors or defects. 
6. If you elect to engage in a “market order” using the Protocol, there is no set minimum number of digital assets you will receive in exchange for your digital assets and the 
   actual results will depend on market conditions. 
7. If you elect to engage in a “limit order” using the Protocol, if the amount of digital assets receivable is below the limit set by you in any trade, such trades may not be 
   executed. In such event, your order may only be partially filled. 

### 2. **Prohibited Conduct**

You warrant and agree that, while accessing or using the Protocol, you will not:

- access, use or attempt to access or use another user’s account, including any private key, public key or wallet address, that you are not authorized to access or use;
- interfere with or disrupt the operation of the Protocol or the servers or networks that host the Network, or disobey any laws, regulations, requirements, procedures, or policies of such servers or networks;

- attempt (or encourage or support anyone else’s attempt) to disable, bypass, modify, defeat, circumvent, reverse-engineer, decrypt, or otherwise alter, or interfere with, the Protocol, including without limitation any security, digital rights management or data encryption components limiting access to Protocol. 

### 3. **Representations and Warranties and Warranty Disclaimers**

The Protocol is deployed on peer-to-peer platforms with a decentralized, blockchain-based architecture designed to provide the Services. As a decentralized protocol, the actual performance of the Protocol is dependent on the collective actions of various participants in the Protocol, including Exchanges and bidders. No party, including the Subject Persons, can exert full control over the operation of the Protocol or the actual results obtained from its use. You acknowledge and agree that the control of the Protocol is distributed and that accordingly no particular party, including the Subject Persons, is able to provide warranties or guarantees regarding the future operations or actual results of any utilizing on the Protocol. 

The Subject Persons do not guarantee the accuracy, timeliness, correctness, completeness, performance or fitness for a particular purpose of the Protocol. They are not liable for any errors, omissions, or inaccuracies. Furthermore, the Subject Persons disclaim: (a) any and all responsibility or liability for the accuracy, content, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability or operability of information or materials displayed on any user interface used to interact with the Protocol; (b) any and all responsibility for the conduct of any user of the Services; (c) any and all responsibility for any harm resulting from utilizing the Protocol; (d) any and all responsibility for any financial gains, losses or tax consequences associated with the your use of the Services through the Protocol.

WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THE TERMS, THE PROTOCOL AND THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROTOCOL SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

NO PARTY WARRANTS THAT THE PROTOCOL OR THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY, SECURE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR OPERATED FREE OF DELAYS IN TRANSMISSION, FAILURE IN PERFORMANCE, COMPUTER VIRUSES, INACCURACIES, ERRORS, OR DEFECTS. YOU USE THE PROTOCOL AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING SUFFICIENT PROCEDURES AND VIRUS CHECKS (INCLUDING ANTI-VIRUS AND OTHER SECURITY CHECKS) TO SATISFY YOUR PARTICULAR REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ACCURACY AND SECURITY OF DATA INPUT AND OUTPUT. THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT THE PROTOCOL WILL MEET USERS’ OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS’ REQUIREMENTS. NO ADVICE, RESULTS OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE PROTOCOL SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR ANY PROBLEMS OR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE PROTOCOL IS TO DISCONTINUE ALL USE OF THE PROTOCOL.

### 4. **Limitation of Liability**

EXCEPT AS SET FORTH HEREIN, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ARISING UNDER ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY WILL THE SUBJECT PERSONS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT ARISE OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE PROTOCOL OR THE SERVICES OR WITH THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROTOCOL, OR FOR ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OBTAINED OR TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED THROUGH THE PROTOCOL, OR FROM THE FAILURE OF THE PROTOCOL TO PERFORM AS DESCRIBED OR EXPECTED, OR FROM THE FAILURE OF THE SUBJECT PARTIES TO PERFORM UNDER THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE PROTOCOL, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THOSE ASPECTS OF THE HEREIN LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, IN WHICH CASE LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

IN NO EVENT SHALL SUCH ENTITIES’ OR PERSONS’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (US$100).
